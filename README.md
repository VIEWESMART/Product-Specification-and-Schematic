# Product-Specification and Schematic
 
 ## This repository is mainly used to store the hardware schematic diagrams (included in the specification sheets) and specification sheets of all our products. The repository directory is divided into specification sheets for Display and Board. However, at present, the directory module divided according to the main control chip of the development board, which is ESP32, is still retained (it will be retained for a period of time and then deleted later). Eventually, for the convenience of searching, the directory structure of my repository will be created in the following style: 
* Product-Specification-and-Schematic
  * Board
    * ESP32
      * 1.3inch
        * Screen Specification Sheet
        * Development Board Specification Sheet
      * 1.9inch

  * Display 
    * HDMI
